# Othello

Othello/Reversi game written in Clojure(script).

## Usage

lein run

If you want to make it executable, lein uberjar.

lein cljsbuild once will also build a JavaScript version.

## Comments
As a point of interest, the initial color flipping logic was a function written for
a 4clojure project. From there, the rest of the game logic and viz took just a few
hours (No complete AI, though).
